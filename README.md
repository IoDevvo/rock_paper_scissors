# rock_paper_scissors

This is the first project of mine involving Javascript. the objective is to build a simple game of rock paper scissors. For now, the game will only have place on the console, with the browser getting the user choice through  a prompt. There will be a set number of rounds, and at the end of each the console will show the result, while keeping track of the score. The final score will determine the winner.
